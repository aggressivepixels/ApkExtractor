# ApkExtractor

**ApkExtractor** is an Android app that allows you to backup and share the apps installed in your device.

I built this app a **LONG** time ago, and I had a lot less experience back then. The code is far from perfect, is poorly organized, it lacks a good `.gitignore`, and for some reason I used the repository to save the built APKs instead of using releases.

The app's still very useful though! Specially if you have no internet access for some reason.

## Installing

You can either:
 - Download the app [here](app/app-release.apk) _or_
 - Sign up for beta testing the app [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.jonathan.apkextractor) and download it from the Play Store _or_
 - Build the app manually

Keep in mind both the Play Store version and the one in the repository are slightly older than the code in the repository, and both are signed with my personal keys, so you won't be able to install a manually built one on top of them.
